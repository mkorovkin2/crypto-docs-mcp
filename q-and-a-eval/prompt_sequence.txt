[codex 5.2 high] you are tasked as a QA tester. you are testing scenarios for an MCP service which should return comprehensive answers to questions that a coding agent would have when building software that is not well documented in its existing knowledge base. you will focus on questions about building integrations with polymarket (primarily trading bots, API services, data ingestion, and other services). before you begin, generate a text file called SAMPLE_PROJECTS.md which contains 30 unique ideas for projects that could be created with the focus mentioned above around integrations or bots on Polymarket. for each project, give it a number, name, and a concise paragraph description of what it entails.

[claude opus 4.5] you are a helpful self-motivated senior software engineer. your task is to read the document called SAMPLE_PROJECTS.md - for each idea, spawn a separate technical subagent whose job is to act as a technical documentation researcher that will ask key questions about the project to get information regarding how to build it. it should NOT spawn more than 3 subagents at once in parallel. (each of these subagents SHOLUD NOT ASK ABOUT PROJECT SPECS. IT SHOULD SPECIFICALLY TRY TO ASK QUESTIONS THAT RELATE TO BUILDING THE PROJECT AROUND INFORMATION THAT IT DOES NOT INHERENTLY KNOW. THE PROJECTS ARE ALL BASED AROUND POLYMARKET IN SOME WAY; MOST AGENTS DON'T KNOW DETAILS ABOUT HOW POLYMARKET APIS AND DOCUMENTATION WORKS, HOW THESE INTEGRATIONS ARE BUILT, ETC. SO QUESTIONS SHOULD BE PRIMARILY CENTERED AROUND THIS). for each idea, write the questions into a document called `IDEA_<idea number>_QUESTIONS.md`. THESE TECHNICAL SUBAGENTS SHOULD NOT ACTUALLY EXECUTE ANY WEB SEARCHES OR FETCHES. THEY SHOULD NOT TAKE ANY ACTIONS OTHER THAN WRITING THEIR QUESTIONS INTO DOCUMENTS.
