write a script in typescript which executes the following: 1. lists all files in the directory, iteratively reads each file that starts with "IDEA_" | 2. opens the file | 3. reads its content using xai grok 4 fast nonthinking model and extracts a simple json list of all the questions explicitly asked there, without numbers (only the question text) | 4. lists all tool calls available at a preconfigured localhost MCP URL | 5. for each question, decides what tool in the MCP server to call based on its content, and calls it | 6. keeps track of the responses, writes the tool call name, params, inputs, and output into a local sqlite database, with a unique ID for the call made | 7. uses OpenAI GPT 5 API to come up with a numerical score of whether the question was answered well and correctly (it should score -1, 0, 1 on a set of evals, including whether the answer was comprehensive, detailed, confident, too long, too short, fully answered, etc.) | 8. write this into a separate sqlite table corresponding to the unique ID of the call and its scores across all these parameers | notes: ensure that you log every step of the flow; and at the beginning of the script, ensure the mcp endpoint is accessible and all API keys for openai/grok are present.
